There are many resources, [articles](http://spriggans-den.com/2021/08/17/why-exploration-works-as-a-game/) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvQ2JgZIjVI) about [how to handle](https://theangrygm.com/getting-there-is-half-the-fun/) (or not handle) **overland travel** in 5th Edition D&D.

This is not one of them.

This is a rules patch for the in-between moments--when the party sets up camp
for the night. It's goal is to:

- Create **roleplay opportunities** between players while on the 'open road'
- Allow **structured downtime** for:
  - Class features (_ex. a Wizards spell transcription_)
  - Optionally enable a crafting system (_gathering materials, learning recipes, creating small items_)
- Introduce some group-tracked resources to **streamline bookkeeping**.
- A vehicle for **nighttime encounters**.
