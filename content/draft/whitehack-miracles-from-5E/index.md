Whitehack contains a creative magic system where instead of learning ‘static’ spells with one well-defined effect (like in D&D 5E), characters can create their own miracle ‘wordings’ to enable dynamic scales of effect, depending on how much they’re willing to invest.

In fact, there is no 'Spells' section of the Whitehack rulebook, only a few miracle wording examples.

This opens up a wildly customizable landscape for magic users to define the effect they have, making magic feel more fluid. It can also present a ‘blank canvas’ problem when the playr sits down to define them, where if anything is possible it becomes hard to make a choice!

What I've attempted here is to take the 'most popular' (see further down) magic classes of D&D 5E and reskin their theme as a Whitehack character to show that with a little bit of creative elbow grease you can still play that concept you've been keeping in your back pocket and enjoy the benefits of an OSR-style system.

Skip the intro! Just show me the Miracles!

## Transitioning from 5E

It’s important to note that magic feels very different between D&D 5E and Whitehack. Whitehack magic is more costly and more dangerous — it literally drains the life out of you to channel these energies. The payoff is that magic is more flexible. As you are presented with new situations, you can bend your magic to meet the situation, depending on how much you’re willing to pay.

Some people coming from D&D 5E or other systems might be initially turned off by the concept of using HP to cast spells. If you focus only on raw, generic uses of magic, you’re likely going to drain your character quickly. The key to making magic more sustainable is to negotiate on the HP cost to cast. Whitehack gives you the following levers to pull when determining a cost:

- Ingredients/materials
- Drawbacks
- Preparing pre-crafted items in downtime
- Area attunement
- Specific uses vs general interpretation.

And the following cost guidelines for effects:

- Simple: 1 hp. Can be achieved without magic.
- Standard: 2 hp. Just beyond the possible.
- Major: d6 hp. A major breach of natural law
- Powerful: 2d6 hp. Use of raw power.

**The cost of a miracle is a multi-point negotiation between these levers and the effect you want to have.** A miracle is made more costly by creating an effect at the logical edge of the miracle wording, bigger effects, more damage, forcing no saves, etc. It is made cheaper by sticking close to the theme of the wording, or with the following:

#### Ingredients/Materials

If you want to lob fire all day, you could spend time and money preparing a type of arcane ammunition, such as balls of bat poop, chunks of phosphorus, or lumps of sulfur. The use of an ingredient will lower the cost of these miracles: tossing a bolt of fire (simple effect, 1d6 ranged damage) becomes 0, a short-range sheet of fire goes from standard (2hp, just beyond possible) to simple (1hp). As long as you have bat poop, flinging fire becomes easier.

#### Drawbacks

When in a bind, you can also lower the cost by willingly adding a negative effect or consequence. You can cast a fireball, but all air from the room is sucked out and everyone starts suffocating, you can heal but the recipient has to relive the damage and spend a short time incapacitated, you can blind the creatures if you must also save against being blinded.

#### Pre-crafted Items

No longer restricted to an artificer type class, you could work to build up expendable uses of an effect. A healing-focused wording could be used to create healing potions. A light-focused miracle wording could be used to create a type of flashbang to improve a party's odds in an assault. A knowledge-focused wording could build up charges in a monocle to read other languages. The possibilities here are powerful and extend your utility greatly with enough downtime and preparation.

#### Area Attunement

Once a day with 10 minutes of focus a Wise character can tap into the local energies and use the same type (necromancy, etc) to reduce costs of a miracle of the same type.

## ‘Most Popular’ 5E Casters

According to [statistics](https://www.belloflostsouls.net/2020/07/dd-and-the-most-popular-class-is.html), these are the top 2 caster subclasses per class in D&D 5e:

- Bard
  - College of Lore
  - College of Glamour
- Cleric
  - Life Domain
  - Tempest Domain
- Druid
  - Circle of Moon
  - Circle of Land
- Sorcerer
  - Draconic Bloodline
  - Wild Magic
- Warlock
  - Fiend Patron
  - Hexblade Patron
- Wizard
  - School of Evocation
  - School of Necromancy

Along with some honorable mentions:

- Bard - College of Swords
- Cleric - Forge Domain

## Guidelines

For each subclass we’re going to include:

- A brief summary of the subclass flavor, and how that could transition into Whitehack
- Two miracle wordings:
  - One ‘active’ wording for dungeon/wilderness traversal.
  - One ‘supporting’ for utility/downtime/research/prep/crafting if possible.
- Drawbacks and preparation ideas to lower HP cost.
- Crafting ideas for each miracle.

It’s assumed that these characters are starting at level 1, so they don’t attempt to capture the full breath of the D&D 5E subclass, but rather the flavor and signature abilities.

Note that each wording doesn’t just have one interpretation or application at each power level. What’s written here is merely a start to get creative juices flowing. In many places I haven’t been explicit about the actual damage costs to leave a buffer for you and your Referee to negotiate.

## Miracle Wordings

### Bard - College of Lore

_Original flavor_: Keepers of lore with insults sharp enough to distract and confuse. They come across as the most bookish of bards, using words more than music.

_Whitehack flavor_: Seekers of secrets both written and mental. Their miracles imbue their words with power, digging deep into hidden fears, repressed desire, and the true nature of things.

_Whitehack flavor_: Knowledge is power! ‘Cutting Words’ is already a fantastic wording. Too harsh for charm effects, but fantastic for breeding doubt and fear and for situational debuffs. This wording is powerful enough to pick up flavors from the College of Whispers as well. Using research as a weapon makes sense for a Lore Bard. Possible avenues to explore could be: learning true names of things for situational advantages, creating spell scrolls of other researched wordings, and using it to augment the task rolls of allies.

**Cutting Words**  
(enchantment, themes: psychic, fear, distraction, )  
Replaces _vicious mockery, cutting words (feature), dissonant whispers, compulsion, command, fear_

| _Powerful (2d6):_ | Recall another recorded miracle on the spot,                                                                                |

### Bard - College of Glamour

_Original flavor:_ Majestic bards trained in the wild ways of the Fey with a specialty in charms and illusions.

_Whitehack flavor:_ You possess a terrible beauty not of this world that you cannot explain. For as long as you can remember minds have bent towards you, moldable to your word and song, like the Sirens of legend. Such is your beauty that you must remain careful not to reveal too much of yourself, to bend their minds too far, or they may never let you go.

_Notes:_ Like the College of Lore, the class features of ‘Enthralling Performance’ and the various glamour-based mantles make for very flavorful wordings. There’s a possibility for a double-edged Siren-type character where their power makes them an obsession to others which could lead to interesting drawbacks and scenarios.

**Enthralling Performance**  
(school, themes: performance, charm, ensnarement, mental manipulation)  
Replaces _sleep, charm person, command, suggestion, zone of truth, geas_

| Type              | Effect                                                                                                                                                          |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| _Standard (2):_   | Charm a person, take control of one sense of your target, make a statement that listeners believe (unless impossible), cause your target to fall into a slumber |
| _Major (d6):_     | Temporarily dominate a targets mind and actions, throw a group into confusion, coax a deep truth out of a enthralled target                                     |
| _Powerful (2d6):_ | Break the mind of your target who becomes your thrall and assists you however it is capable                                                                     |
| _Crafted:_        | Imbue an object with an echo of your performance, causing anyone who touches it to spend a few rounds hypnotized                                                |
| _Drawbacks:_      | Others not your intended target must also save or be affected                                                                                                   |
| _Preparations:_   | Instruments, enchanted strings, megaphone to enhance or increase the volume of your performance                                                                 |

**Mantle of Glamour**  
(school, themes: illusion, self-targeted)  
Replaces _disguise self, invisibility, blur, tasha’s hideous laughter, weird_

| Type              | Effect                                                                                                                                                                        |

| _Standard (2):_   | The location of your true physical presence becomes hard to perceive and you gain 3 AC, mimic another person’s appearance                                                     |
| _Major (d6):_     | Reveal your unearthly beauty to cause others who gaze upon you to weep uncontrollably, bend light to disappear from view                                                      |
| _Powerful (2d6):_ | Your glamour reveals your beautiful and terrible majesty, all who see you are either terrified or drawn to you (your choice) as their minds begin to crumble (psychic damage) |
| _Crafted:_        |                                                                                                                                                                               |
| _Drawbacks:_      | You reveal too much and your targets must save or become violently possessive of you or jealous of anyone you’re with                                                         |
| _Preparations:_   | Makeup, scarves, or clothing items to help reveal/conceal your beauty                                                                                                         |

### Cleric - Life Domain

_Original flavor:_ The classic cleric. Heals from inside a tin can with a large grudge against the undead.

_Whitehack Flavor:_ Chosen zealots from the clergy of She Who Bleeds are commonly known as 'Blood Priests' for their red vestments and the tears of blood they cry when they invoke the powers of their god. The source of their miracles is a fierce debate among arcane scholars: whether it is their connection to their deity or their intense will made manifest. Despite their ominous reputation, Blood Priests commonly render aid to the oppressed and downtrodden, occasionally acting as inquisitors and arbiters of immediate justice.

_Note_: The theme of martyrdom reinforces the magical healing of Whitehack—they give of themselves so that others can live. For the AC considerations, I’ve included the possibility of a bound magical item (available at level 3). This could be a status of rank within your group, or a gift to aid on a quest.

**Balm of the Martyr**  
(necromancy, themes: healing, purifying)  
Replaces: _guidance, cure wounds, bless, lesser restoration, revivify_

| Type         | Effect                                                                                                       |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Minor:_     | Restore low HP, fortify a stat for a single roll                                                             |
| _Standard:_  | Cure disease or negative status effects, fortify attacks                                                     |
| _Major:_     | Regrow limbs                                                                                                 |
| _Powerful:_  | Raise dead, restore large amounts of HP                                                                      |
| _Crafted:_   | Vials of blessed oil that function as potions of healing.                                                    |
| _Drawbacks:_ | Targets must relive the pain of the injury and must save or spend their next round stunned or incapacitated. |

**Wounds of the Martyr**  
(necromancy, themes: damage, retribution, transference )  
Replaces _inflict wounds, warding bond, curse, turn undead_

| Type         | Effect                                                                                                                                           |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Minor:_     | Inflict magical wounds, cause minor open wounds that will not close (ongoing damage)                                                             |
| _Standard:_  | Anyone who attacks you has the wound reflected for d6 damage, life transference between two creatures, inflict mental wounds to hamper or debuff |
| _Major:_     | Inflict serious magical wounds, afflict target with curse                                                                                        |
| _Powerful:_  | Rebuke the heretics and abominations who must cower before you as bleeding wounds open across their bodies                                       |
| _Crafted:_   | Create Vials of blessed blood that cause weeping blood and sorrow on contact (ongoing damage, or minor debuff)                                   |
| _Drawbacks:_ | The caster weeps tears of blood, obscuring vision (temporary debuff to AV and to perceive things)                                                |

**Celestial Vestments**
Heavy item (2 slots), Magic Armor (3 AC)

This set of vestments is reinforced with the blessed bones of a celestial whale said to have died in the War of Crimson Night. The wearer occasionally has dreams of swimming through a sea of stars.

If bound to the 3rd level slot, you can spend 1HP to strengthen armor (+1 AC) and manifest a shield and helmet for an hour. (4 AC + 1 shield = 5 AC total). These do not not increase the cost of miracles.

> This item suggestion has been provided as a way to negotiate the low AC of the Wise class and preserve the ‘heals from a tin can’ flavor of the original cleric D&D class.

### Cleric - Tempest Domain

Theme: Storms, lightning, thunder
Signature Abilities: Wrath of the Storm (magical counterattack), Destructive Wrath (max lightning)
Signature Spells: Thunderwave, Fog Cloud, Gust of Wind

_Original flavor:_ Devotees to Gods as tempestuous as their manifestations, they bring justice, valuing strength, violence, and freedom.

_Whitehack flavor:_ Followers of the Storm Wind are treated with caution. They are chaotic agents of change and destruction, keeping no home, only following the prompting of the Storm Wind. Followers have been known to devolve into a possessed rage, embodying the destructive nature of the storms they follow.

_Notes:_ You’ll note a conspicuous lack of ranged lightning attacks. This is on purpose, as some type of similar wording will be the top choice for the next slot when that type of magic is more feasible. The ‘Heart of the Storm’ is mainly meant to get you into the fray, the center of chaos and destruction.

**Heart of the Storm**  
(evocation, themes: lightning, storm, self-focused)  
Replaces _Wrath of the Storm, elemental weapon_

| Type              | Effect                                                                                                                                                        |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| _Simple (1):_     | Channel the storm into your weapon and gain +2 AV and +1 lightning damage on attacks for an hour, your eyes crackle and glow bright enough to cast light      |
| _Standard (2): _  | Wreathe self in storm energy so attackers take minor lightning damage (1d6-2) and you gain 2 AC for the day, touch your target to stun them with storm energy |
| _Major (d6):_     | A storm bursts from within, damaging everything close to you.                                                                                                 |
| _Powerful (2d6):_ | You manifest the Storm Wind which creates a zone of destruction around it that moves randomly each round                                                      |

### Druid - Circle of the Moon

_Original flavor:_ TBD

_Whitehack flavor:_ TBD

_Notes:_ In 5E part of the Druids utility comes from becoming a large sack of HP everytime they shift. Ported over raw this could cause some major balance issues — the Wise druid’s survivability would skyrocket. The main intent here is to allow a ‘combat form’, so we should allow it but keep the Wise’s HP total the same while they shift. I’ve placed a few limitation so we’re not stealing too much of the Strong’s schtick.

**Beast Shape**  
(transmutation, themes: shapeshifting)  
Replaces _primal savagery, wild shape, alter self_

| Type              | Effect                                                                                    |

| _Powerful (2d6):_ | Become an Avatar of Nature                                                                |
| _Crafted:_        | Vials of poison or toxin extracted from your own beast form                               |

| _Preparations:_   | Preparing totems or fetishes of animal forms (teeth, hair, etc)                           |

This shift lasts until you die, choose a new form, or voluntarily end the shift. Your HP and other stats remain the same but your AC, MV, and AV changes to your beast form. While in Beast Shape, you cannot perform other miracles, but you can spend 2 hp to swap an adaptation or enhancement.

- **Small Beast**, AC 0, MV 30, AV 8, Damage 1d6-2, Choose one adaptation and one enhancement:

  - Adaptation: wings (flight), fins and gills (water breathing), quadruped shape (+10 speed)

  - Adaptation: Scaled hide (AC +2), Poisonous bite or sting (SV or poisoned), Predator vision (AV +2)
  - Enhancement: jump double distances, ability to climb sheer surfaces

- **Avatar of Nature**, AC 4, MV 30, AV 16, Damage 1d6+2, Choose one adaptation and one enhancement:
  - Adaptation: Barkskin (AC +3, MV -5), Iron Jaws (bite restrains enemy, double positive rolls on restrained target), Jagged Claws (create open wounds for ongoing damage),

Shadow Hex
Entropy based effects and debuffs

_Original flavor:_ TBD

_Notes:_ The sentient weapon is key to this concept, so it shouldn’t be tied behind a slot that could be deactivated. Different miracles are intended to evoke different aspects of the Hexblade.

### Wizard - School of Evocation

_Original flavor:_ TBD

_Whitehack flavor:_ TBD

_Notes:_ The Draconic Bloodline covers the ‘blaster’ side of this archetype fairly well, so this translation will focus more on control of the elements themselves. Just listing a type of element is too general for practical use, so I would encourage pairings with a clarifying/limited word: Cleansing Water, Tearing Wind, etc.

## Honorable Mentions

### Bard - College of Sword

_Original flavor_: Circus performer with a side of bravo and assassin and an emphasis on a secret life or agenda.

_Whitehack flavor_: A performer secretly trained in an ancient martial form that requires ritual bloodletting, unifying body and blade to perform extraordinary feats. Their order, the Sanguine Artisans, has produced legendary assassins, able to assume undetectable disguises. The order is thought to be long dead, which is how they prefer it.

_Notes:_ Melee for the Wise is tricky but doable, and requires miracle assistance due to low AV and the armor restrictions. The dances are intended to be 'stances' that function as longer duration buffs that progressively stack. How long these stances last will have to be a conversation with the Referee, perhaps active for as long as the ritual blood remains on the skin (potentially all day) or just as long as they keep their blade drawn (minor restriction, making it harder to perform certain tasks one-handed). The balance point should be to make sure their skills don’t overshadow the Strong, so all buffs have been pitched as slightly weaker in pure numbers but provide some alternative melee options. This concept will hit hard, but burn out quickly

**Dance of Blade and Blood**  
(transmutation, themes: dance, melee)  
Replaces _blade flourish, mage armor, longstrider, jump_

### Cleric - Forge Domain Cleric

_Original flavor:_ Blacksmiths with faith in the divine. And fire. Preferably both at the same time.

_Whitehack flavor:_ A mystic metallurgist devoted to the gods of craft. Often referred to as 'Metal Priests' they are both valued and feared for their ability to shape and control metal.

_Notes:_ What do you get with molecular manipulation of metal? Magnets! This opens up pulling from the Magneto playbook as an option. The artisan focus mixes very well into Whitehack’s crafted rules.
