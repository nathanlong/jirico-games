With the rise of Virtual Tabletops (VTTs) instead of minis, we need tokens. To
make tokens, we need a categorized collection of quality artwork.

This is my collection.

Most of the categories reflect the traditional races, monster groupings, and
organizations of D&D, but can be applied to any fantasy RPG.

I also recommend this [token generator](http://rolladvantage.com/tokenstamp/) for quick and easy cropping for VTTs. (Make sure to explore your border options).
