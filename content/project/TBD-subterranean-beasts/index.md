In D&D 5th Edition, druids are intimately connected to nature. But what if the 'nature' you draw on is underground? How do Druids work in the Underdark? In what ways would a dwarf, drow, or deep gnome Druid differ from surface Druids?

Likewise, how would a dwarf who spent most of their life below the surface have seen Dire Wolfs and Brown Bears before?

This guide is for those who want to run Subterranean Druids, giving balanced options for the Wildshape feature and serving as a Bestiary for additional subterranean fauna.
