With the release of Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything we saw both the Aberrant Mind and Clockwork Soul sorcerer get released with an expanded spell list, nearly doubling the amount of spells available to the sorcerer. This greatly increases the flexibility of the class, bringing it closer in line with the Bard for spell options. Following that pattern this is a series of spell lists that can be added to each previous Sorcerous Origin. Each follows the these rules:

- Theme over power (choices are meant to be thematic, not optimal)
- Expanded initial list (initial lists can be pulled from outside the initial class, but attempt to remain thematic to the subclass, ie Divine Soul)
- Strict retraining criteria (limited options to replace each spell)

## Draconic Bloodline Origin

> Note: The Draconic Bloodline, with it’s strong elemental focus poses a challenge in that not all damage types have appropriate spells for each tier. To that end, I’ve combined the less populated damage types and created a new spell based from cone of cold to represent the realization of a dragon's most powerful feature: their breath weapons.

### Draconic Spells

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Draconic Spells table as well as the Ancestral Spells as determined by the type of your Dragon Ancestor. Damage from your Ancestral Spell count toward your Elemental Affinity feature. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an evocation or an enchantment spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

#### Draconic Spells (All ancestries)

<div class="designer-note">

#### Elemental Breath

_5th level evocation_  
**Casting time**: 1 action  
**Range**: Self (60-foot cone OR 90-foot long and 10-foot wide line)  
**Components**: V, S  
**Duration**: Instantaneous

You awaken your draconic ancestry and expel elemental energy from your mouth. Each creature in a 60-foot cone (fire, cold) or a 90-foot long 10-foot wide line (Acid/Poison, Lightning/Thunder) must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 elemental damage that matches your draconic ancestry on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

## Wild Magic Origin

### Wild Spells

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Wild Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an enchantment or a transmutation spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

| Level | Spells                         |

| 7th   | confusion, polymorph           |
| 9th   | animate objects, wall of force |

## Divine Soul Origin

> Note: Similar to the Draconic Ancestry origin, the divine soul requires a split list to satisfy the character options.

### Divine Magic

Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells from the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Divine Spells table as well as the Divine Source Spells as determined by the affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be from the cleric spell list.

| 7th   | guardian of faith             |
| 9th   | summon celestial‡             |

## Shadow Magic Origin

> Note: Necromancy is another real challenge, requiring a visit to the cleric list for meaningful and thematic spells in a list of otherwise underwhelming options. I purposely avoided the arms of Hadar and hunger of Hadar as options as they’re used in the Aberrant Mind origin, which would cause too much overlap. Darkness at 3rd level was kept to preserve the Eyes of the Dark ability.

### Shadow Spells

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Shadow Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an illusion or an necromancy spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

| Level | Spells                                        |
| :---- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| 1st   | inflict wounds, cause fear                    |
| 3rd   | phantasmal force, darkness (Eyes of the Dark) |
| 5th   | summon shadowspawn‡, speak with dead          |
| 7th   | shadow of moil†, death ward                   |
| 9th   | creation, negative energy flood†              |

## Storm Sorcerery Origin

> Note: Unlike other origins, storm magic is a well explored topic in 5e providing many thematic options.

### Storm Spells

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Storm Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a conjuration or evocation spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

| Level | Spells                                   |
| :---- | :--------------------------------------- |
| 1st   | fog cloud, thunderwave                   |

For summon elemental, unless you gain this spell from another source you can only summon air and water elementals.
