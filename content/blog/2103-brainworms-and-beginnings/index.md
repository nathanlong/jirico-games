There are many blogs about RPGs. This one is mine. Indulge me as I navel-gaze about my entrance into the hobby.

### An Origin Story

Until a few years ago, to me "RPG" meant **Japanese RPG video game** — like Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger. My first glimpse into Tabletop RPGs is likely common among this new generation of gamers: I saw an episode of [Critical Role](https://critrole.com/).

That was the first time I said, wait... THIS is what Dungeons and Dragons looks like?! There's no baby-eating or weird re-enactments of occult paganism like the media had told me D&D was all about! I have always loved turned-based strategy games like Shining Force, Ogre Battle, XCOM, etc. So when Mercer then proceeded to pull out a grid, placed it on the table, and everyone started playing a turned-based tactical combat scenario I nearly fell over. I saw the root of all the things I loved in a game.

I went back and consumed a large part of Critical Role's first campaign, then immediately started devouring other D&D podcasts like [The Adventure Zone](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/adventure-zone/), [Not Another D&D Podcast](https://www.naddpod.com/), and [Acquisitions Incorporated: C Team](https://www.acq-inc.com/cteam/). I got my grubby mitts on a copy of the 5E Player Handbook and read the whole thing. I immersed myself in the forums on builds, plots, adventures and systems. Everything was shiny and I knew THIS is what I had been missing.

### In the Hot Seat

It came up in conversation one day — a friend of mine had a D&D 5E campaign that had petered out. We joked we should start our own campaign. A few weeks later the joke became real when I offered to DM a game and we opened up an invite to a larger group of friends. We cast the net wide, thinking only 30-50% would bite. 10 people showed up.

I found myself in the DM chair of a large group and rapidly started consuming advice on how to even pull this off. I worked through most of Matthew Colville's excellent [Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlUk42GiU2guNzWBzxn7hs8MaV7ELLCP_) series, I slogged through the [Angry GM's ranting advice](https://theangrygm.com/), I scoured Reddit. My eyes were opened to the mysteries behind the DM screen and I dove into a weekly game that would continue for over two years.

### Expectation Meets Reality

Early on, I ran off sheer enthusiasm, brute forcing my way through awkward scenarios and encounters. I learned what our version of authentic D&D looked like: when the game is played by your friends, not voice actors playing for an internet audience. I learned that NPC's were one of my most powerful tools to foster role-play. I wove material outside the written bounds of the adventure, adding actions and motives to otherwise static villains. I improvised on rulings and worked to make 'Fun' the king at the table. There were jokes and good times all around.

But not everything was shiny anymore.

I had trouble filling the emptiness that was baked into our chosen adventure. Combat was slow. I was concerned about ‘balance’ so I often created underpowered combat scenarios. Traveling was a joke, and my invented travel rules made it worse. Inventory tracking was largely meaningless with a huge encumbrance limit and little need to rely on gear. I attempted a crafting system and made it needlessly complex. The players figured out the game was built for balanced combat and that they had a limited form of plot armor against true death, despite my accidental killing of a character. With such a large group, eventually some dropped out, stating they felt they had a limited chance to influence the game world with so many at the table.

### Revelation, Take Two

So I went back, looking for patches to apply to my leaking boat of enthusiasm. It’s at this point I started hearing about the ‘Old School Renaissance’ or OSR. I initially dismissed it, wondering why anyone would want to revert to old versions. It wasn’t until I read a [“Around the OSR in Five Games”](https://cannibalhalflinggaming.com/2020/03/25/around-the-osr-in-five-games/) That I started to think there really might be something to it. So I read [Old School Essentials](https://necroticgnome.com/collections/old-school-essentials), [Black Hack](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255088/The-Black-Hack-Second-Edition?affiliate_id=2038616), [Whitehack](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348152/Whitehack-Third-Edition?affiliate_id=2038616), [Lamentations of the Flame Princess](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/115059/LotFP-Rules--Magic-Free-Version?manufacturers_id=2795&affiliate_id=2038616), and others.

There’s a paragraph in the intro section of OSE that finally made it click:

> The old-school gaming scene is sitting on a secret: a huge number of games, despite having different brand names on their covers, are highly compatible! This cross-compatibility between many games means that a great wealth of adventures,
> campaign settings, and rules supplements can be used with Old-School Essentials.  
> <small>— Gavin Norman, OSE Rules Tome, 2nd Printing, pg 9</small>

You mean to tell me I can mix and match systems and modules for over 40 years worth of battle-tested content?! And that new, high-quality content is coming out all the time for these systems? I stopped drinking the Wizards of the Coast adventure Kool-Aid and found truly amazing adventures [just](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/patrick-wetmore/ase1-anomalous-subsurface-environment-pdf/ebook/product-qk2dy9.html) [waiting](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/270795/Winters-Daughter-OldSchool-Essentials-Version?affiliate_id=2038616) [to be](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/301207/Ragged-Hollow-Nightmare-A-Dungeon-Age-Adventure-5e-and-OSR-versions?affiliate_id=2038616) [pilfered](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/131801/Deep-Carbon-Observatory?affiliate_id=2038616) [for my](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/195785/Maze-of-the-Blue-Medusa-o-Deluxe-PDF?affiliate_id=2038616) [table](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/215340/The-Dark-of-Hot-Springs-Island?affiliate_id=2038616).

I finally understood why OSR was a thing. It fixes a lot of the problems I found at my 5E table. Character creation no longer takes an hour or more per character, cross-referencing between different books. Combat is fast and streamlined (and also highly lethal) BUT combat is actually better avoided! Gold as XP suddenly removes a good chunk of the incentive to slay everything that moves and rely on creative solutions to navigate danger.

Don’t misunderstand me. D&D 5E is still a great system. It will forever be my first RPG love and I still regularly run a 5E table. But while 5E excels at the narrative-heavy heroic arc, OSR is much friendlier to the DM/GM/Referee, rewards creative thinking, and it’s hackability is simply wonderful. Neither is good or bad in themselves, just different. And that’s exciting.

### Why We're Here

That's why I'm here. I love this hobby. Hacking systems and adventures scratch all the creative itches I have: art, writing, systems creation, programming, organizing. It's like a worm in my brain that won't stop wiggling until I throw the ideas at the wall to see their shape. This is my space, my wall. I'm throwing what the brainworms urge me to, and I expect it to get messy. Maybe it will help someone else, but it will most certainly help ME.

### What's Your Story?

But enough about me. What was your first system? How did you enter into the hobby? What are you playing now?
